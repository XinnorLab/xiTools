# Role **raid_fs**
Creates xiRAID arrays and tuned XFS filesystems as per Xinnor NFS RDMA blog.

## Variables
* `xiraid_arrays` – list of array definitions (name, level, devices, strip size, parity).
* `xfs_filesystems` – list defining data/log device pairs, mount point, mkfs params.
* `xiraid_license_path` – path to license file applied before arrays are created.
* `xiraid_force_metadata` – when `true` add `--force_metadata` to array creation.
* `xfs_force_mkfs` – when `true` always run `mkfs.xfs` even if the filesystem and label already match. By default this is `true`, so filesystems are recreated on every run.

This role requires the **mdadm** package to be installed so that any
leftover Linux MD arrays on xiRAID devices can be stopped and wiped.

All drives referenced by the array and spare pool definitions are
cleaned using `xicli drive clean -d <device>` (or `--drives`) before
new pools or arrays are created.

Filesystems are mounted using dedicated systemd mount units generated by the
role. Each unit references the underlying block device and is enabled so that
mounting happens at boot. This follows the
[xiRAID documentation on file system mounting](https://xinnor.io/docs/xiRAID-4.3.0/E/en/AG/2/file_system_mounting_examples.html).

Array creation is idempotent. If a RAID with the same name already
exists in the xiRAID configuration file, the role will skip creation
without failing.

## Example playbook
```yaml
- hosts: storage_nodes
  roles:
    - raid_fs
```
